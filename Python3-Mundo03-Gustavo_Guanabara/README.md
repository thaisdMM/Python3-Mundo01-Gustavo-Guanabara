## 🎯 Skills Developed

- Efficient manipulation of composite structures: tuples, lists, and dictionaries.  
- Creation, documentation, and use of functions to modularize code.  
- Project organization with modularization, including creation of modules and packages.  
- Application of error and exception handling to improve program robustness.  
- Introduction to file handling: creating, reading, and checking the existence of text files (.txt).

## 📝 Practice Performed

Total of 44 exercises solved, numbered from 72 to 115.

It is worth mentioning that I completed all exercises, including some where my solution differs from the instructor’s. In those cases, the instructor’s code is noted at the end of my solution or there is a second file with the same exercise number followed by the letter “b,” which contains the instructor’s solution.
