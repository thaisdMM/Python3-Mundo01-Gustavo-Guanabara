# Python 3 Course – Gustavo Guanabara (Curso em Vídeo)

This repository is organized into three folders, representing the three modules of the basic Python course taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara, available on the Curso em Vídeo website or YouTube:

- World 1 – Python Fundamentals  
- World 2 – Control Structures  
- World 3 – Composite Structures and Functions  

The course has a highly __practical__ approach, focusing on the construction and development of programming logic through applied exercises. Throughout the three worlds, 115 exercises were completed, including various projects that facilitate learning, such as simple games, data manipulation, and a small system.

## Course Methodology

The methodology emphasizes the gradual understanding of concepts, starting from basic fundamentals such as:

- __Primitive types__  
- __Input and output__ (input and print)  
- __Conditional structures__ (if, else, elif)  

To progress to more advanced concepts such as:

- __Composite structures__ (lists, tuples, dictionaries)  
- __Functions and code modularization__  
- __Error and exception handling__  
- __File manipulation__  

---

## Objective and Outcome

This extensive practice contributes to consolidating __logical reasoning__ and best practices in Python, preparing the student for real programming challenges, especially in beginner projects.

---

## Developed Skills (Summary)

- Understanding and manipulation of __primitive types__  
- __Control structures__ and conditional logic  
- Use and manipulation of __composite data structures__ (lists, tuples, dictionaries)  
- Creation and use of __functions__ and code modularization  
- Application of __error and exception handling__  
- Basic __file manipulation__ (reading, creation, and verification)
