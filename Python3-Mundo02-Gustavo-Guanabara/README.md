## 📝 Practice Performed

Total of 36 exercises solved, numbered from 36 to 71.

It is worth mentioning that I completed all exercises, including some where my solution differs from the instructor's. In those cases, the instructor’s code was noted at the end of my solution, or there is a second file with the same exercise number followed by the letter "b," which contains the instructor's solution.
